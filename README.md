# Introduction

Feedback from a customer is seen as one of the most valuable resource
for any company irrespective of the scale that it has been established
on. But on the flipside, for a customer, both providing feedback via call
and via dedicated forms, is a cumbersome process which doesn’t
benefit them in any fashion. Therefore, there is an immediate and
acute need for a system using which, company can get hands on
genuine feedback without disturbing the customers in any fashion.
Our Product AFS (Automated Feedback System) aims to bridge the gap
between the customers and the company, by automatically generating
the much-required feedback using customer care calls. The feedback
can further used to generate periodic reports to the HR to analyze the
performance of the customer care executives, reports to the quality
manager about the product usage and reception etc. Thus, it can be
further used to strategies the implementations, sales and marketing.
Thus, our product delivers a one stop automated solution to satiate
multiple loopholes in the Feedback system and benefit all the facets of
the firm related to it.
